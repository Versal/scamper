[spray-can](http://can.spray.io) is a low-overhead, high-performance, fully asynchronous HTTP 1.1 server and client library
implemented entirely in Scala on top of [Akka][].

Both, the _spray-can_ server and the _spray-can_ client, sport the following features:

* Low per-connection overhead for supporting thousands of concurrent connections
* Efficient message parsing and processing logic for high throughput applications (> 50K requests/sec on ordinary consumer hardware)
* Full support for HTTP/1.1 persistant connections
* Full support for message pipelining
* Full support for asynchronous HTTP streaming (i.e. "chunked" transfer encoding)
* Akka-Actor and -Future based architecture for easy integration into your Akka applications
* No dependencies except for JavaSE 6, Scala 2.9 and [Akka][] 1.2 (actors module).

This is the first public release.
