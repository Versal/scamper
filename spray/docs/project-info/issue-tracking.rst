Issue Tracking
==============

Currently the *spray* team uses the `Issues Page`_ of the projects `github repository`_ for issue management.
If you find a bug and would like to report it please go there and create an issue.

If you are unsure, whether the problem you've found really is a bug please ask on the :ref:`mailing-list` first.
