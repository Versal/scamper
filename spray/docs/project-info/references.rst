`VMware <http://www.vmware.com>`_
  Thanks again for all your hard work on spray. The vCloud Integration Manager wouldn't have shipped (at least on time)
  without it, and we look forward to continuing to use it in our current project as well. :-)

`Ebay <http://www.ebay.com>`_
  We are using spray for an internal project here at ebay. It is quite small, and it was mostly as an excuse to learn
  about actor-based programming, but so far we have been very impressed by *sprays* performance and simplicity and the
  fantastic support on the user group.

`yardi.com <http://www.yardi.com>`_
  We're using *spray* for a sizeable set of REST web services for our real-estate platform. Some of the services are a
  REST-based event bus, a notification/email system, a rights-management system (kind of like an authority/security
  system), and many others. We're getting excellent use out of *spray*, and want to pass on our thanks again for all
  the work!

`telfish.com <http://www.telfish.com>`_
  We are using *spray-can*, *spray-server* and *spray-json* for our customer-facing query API for more than a year now
  and are very happy with it. Our API code is robust, fast and easy to maintain.

`Zuberance <http://www.zuberance.com>`_
  We developed a new product completely on top of Scala/Akka/spray and are just finishing up beta.

`system insights <http://systeminsights.com>`_
  We converted from Jersey, which took about 2 weeks. The testability of spray is great -- and runs fast.
