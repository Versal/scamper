*spray* was influenced by many projects, but the following ones especially stand out:

BlueEyes_
  Another functional web service building toolkit for Scala. *sprays* HTTP model was originally based on the
  one from BlueEyes and the core ideas of the routing DSL are also heavily inspired by what the BlueEyes team
  made available.

Netty_
  Netty is an excellent choice if you need to build asynchronous event-driven network applications with Java.
  *spray* adopted Nettys upstream/downstream pipelining approach for its :ref:`spray-io` module.
