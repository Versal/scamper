Getting Started
===============

In order to get you started quickly with a *spray*-based project of your own we maintain two project templates on
github that you can clone and use as a basis. They live in two branches of the spray-template_ github project:

- Clone the on_spray-can_ branch, if you'd like to run *spray-routing* on :ref:`spray-can`
- Clone the on_jetty_ branch, if you'd like to run *spray-routing* on :ref:`spray-servlet`
