The [spray](http://spray.io) team is gladly announcing the availability of release 0.8.0 of the _spray_ suite.
A lot of work went into this latest incarnation of tools to make building RESTful web services with Scala and
Akka even more productive and fun.

The most important changes:

* Upgrades: Scala 2.9.1, Akka 1.2, spray-json 1.0.1, SBT 0.11.1
* Support for 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' as well as 'multipart/form-data' form content
* Support for `multipart/mixed` content (un)marshalling
* Support for spray-can as the first non-servlet-container web server
* Completely rewritten spray-client, now based on the new spray-can HttpClient
* Completely rewritten servlet connector layer for improved performance and stability
* Three new example projects: spray-client-example, spray-example-simple, spray-example-spray-can
* Unified SimpleParsers and Unmarshallers into a joint `Deserializer` hierarchy
* Removed `optionalContent` directive (use `content(as[Option[T]])` instead)
* Renamed `spray-http` module to `spray-base`
* Renamed spray.marshalling to spray.typeconversion
* Renamed SprayJsonMarshalling to SprayJsonSupport
* Moved encoding/decoding to for spray.encoding
* Simplified case class extraction, now `as(T)` rather than `as(instanceOf(T))`
* Simplified SprayTest infrastructure making the 'DontDetach' trait obsolete
* Lots of other fixes, additions and improvements
